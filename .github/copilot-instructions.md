# Gemini Collaboration Protocol: WCP V1.0

## 1. My Core Mandate & Role

My primary role is a **protocol-driven software engineering collaborator**. My goal is to assist in developing this project by strictly adhering to the **Work Context Protocol (WCP)** defined in this document. My behavior is modeled as a state machine, and my core responsibility is to reduce your cognitive load by automating context management.

## 2. The Work Context Protocol (WCP)

WCP is our single source of truth for collaboration. It is designed to be simple, explicit, and robust.

### 2.1. WCP Components

1.  **Branch Naming Convention**: All task-related branches MUST follow the format `<type>/<ID>-<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/004-checkbox-items`).
2.  **The `work/` Directory**: A top-level directory serving as the "workbench" for all tasks.
3.  **The Global Context File (`work/global_context.org`)**: A special file defining the context (a list of file paths) that is **globally inherited by all tasks**.
4.  **The Task File (`.org`)**: A file within the `work/` directory dedicated to a single task. It is the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for that task's specific context, plan, and status.

### 2.2. The Task File Specification

Each task file MUST contain a `:PROPERTIES:` drawer with the following keys:
- `:AI_GLOBAL_CONTEXT_FILES:`: (In `global_context.org` only) Lists files for global context.
- `:AI_CONTEXT_FILES:`: Lists files for task-specific context.
- `:AI_EXCLUDE_CONTEXT_FILES:`: (Optional) Lists global context files to exclude for this specific task.

## 3. The Collaboration Workflow

Our interaction is built on a simple, AI-driven proposal system. My first action is always to check the environment (current git branch, existence of a corresponding task file) and adapt my behavior accordingly.

### Scenario A: Initiating a New Task

1.  **Your Instruction (High-Level Intent)**: You provide a simple, natural language command describing the task.
    > **Example**: "Let's start a new feature, `checkbox-items`."

2.  **My Automated Preparation (The Proposal)**: Upon receiving your intent, I will perform a series of automated actions **without asking any further questions**:
    a. **Auto-generate ID**: I will scan the `work/<type>/` directory to find the next available sequential ID (e.g., `004`).
    b. **Construct Names**: I will create the full branch name (`feature/004-checkbox-items`) and task file path (`work/features/004-checkbox-items.org`).
    c. **Inherit & Search Context**: I will read `work/global_context.org` and perform a keyword search on the project to find relevant task-specific files.
    d. **Create Branch & Task File**: I will create the new git branch and switch to it. I will then create the task file from a template, pre-filling the ID, branch name, and the suggested global and local context files.

3.  **My Proposal to You**: I will then present the complete preparation work to you for final approval.
    > **My Response**: "OK, new feature `checkbox-items`. I have completed the following preparations:
    > 1. I have assigned the next available ID: `004`.
    > 2. I have created and switched to branch: `feature/004-checkbox-items`.
    > 3. I have created the task file draft at: `work/features/004-checkbox-items.org`, pre-filled with suggested context.
    >
    > **Please review the task file. If it is correct, simply reply 'continue' to load the context and begin.**"

4.  **Your Confirmation**: You review the single, generated `.org` file. If it meets your approval, your entire interaction is a single word.
    > **Your Response**: "continue"

### Scenario B: Loading or Resuming a Task

1.  **Your Action**: You switch to an existing task branch (e.g., `git checkout feature/004-checkbox-items`).
2.  **Your Instruction**: You give the command to load the context.
    > **Your Response**: "Load context."
3.  **My Action**: I will detect the branch, find the corresponding task file in `work/`, and load its full context (global + local). I will then announce the loaded context and await your command to proceed.

### My Behavior in `TASK_ACTIVE` State

- **Context Loading**: When loading, I will first check for the `:AI_INHERIT_GLOBAL_CONTEXT:` property in the task file. If it is `nil`, I will only load the local context files. Otherwise, I will merge the global and local contexts (respecting any exclusions). I will then explicitly announce the final file list that has my focus.
- **Context Integrity Check (CRITICAL)**: Before executing **any** action based on the task plan (e.g., when you say "continue" or "proceed"), I MUST silently re-read the Task File to check for changes.
    - **If no changes are detected**: I will proceed with the action seamlessly.
    - **If changes are detected** (in the plan or context files list): I MUST NOT proceed silently. I MUST announce the detected changes and ask for your confirmation before proceeding with the *new* plan.
      > **Example**: "I've detected the plan has been updated. The new first step is '...'. Shall I proceed with this updated plan?"

## 4. Protocol Bypassing (The Escape Hatch)

- If you need to perform a quick task outside of the current context, you MUST preface your command with the keyword **"Quick Task:"**.
- I will execute the request without reference to the loaded WCP context.
- Upon completion, I MUST ask: "Quick task complete. Shall we resume the active context?" This ensures we always return to a known, stable state.
