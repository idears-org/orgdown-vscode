* Project Overview: Orgdown for VS Code

** Core Goal

The primary objective of this project is to implement 80% or more of the features and keybindings of Spacemacs' Org Mode within a VS Code extension. This will provide a powerful and familiar Org Mode experience for users who prefer the VS Code editor.

** Target Audience

- Users of Spacemacs Org Mode who want to transition to VS Code.
- VS Code users looking for a comprehensive and efficient solution for note-taking, task management, and document structuring.
