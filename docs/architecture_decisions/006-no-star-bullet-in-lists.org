#+TITLE: [ADR-006] - No '*' Bullet in Lists
#+DATE: 2025-08-05
#+ADR_NUMBER: 006
#+STATUS: Accepted
#+DECISION_MAKER: Human Developer

* Context
Org Mode allows the use of the star character (*) as a bullet for unordered lists. However, this conflicts with the use of * for headlines, leading to ambiguity and potential parsing errors. In practice, most Org files use - and + for list bullets, and * as a bullet is rare.

* Decision
The Orgdown VS Code extension will NOT support * as a bullet for list items. Only - and + will be recognized as valid unordered list bullets.

* Consequences
- Removes ambiguity between headlines and list items.
- Simplifies grammar and implementation.
- Reduces risk of parsing errors and user confusion.
- Slightly diverges from the full Org Mode spec, but only in a rarely used area.
- Org files using * as a bullet will not be parsed as lists; users should convert such bullets to - or +.

* Alternatives Considered
- Supporting * as a bullet: increases complexity and ambiguity, not recommended.
- Warning users about unsupported bullets: could be added in future for better UX.
