* 1. Summary
  A brief, one-to-two-sentence summary of the feature.

* 2. Background and Motivation
  Explain the "why" behind this feature. What user problem does it solve? What is the context?

* 3. User Stories
  - *As a* [type of user], *I want to* [perform some action], *so that I can* [achieve some goal].
  - *As a* [another type of user], *I want to* [perform another action], *so that I can* [achieve another goal].

* 4. Functional Requirements
  This section details the specific behaviors of the feature. Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY).
  - The system *MUST* provide a command named ~orgdown.newFeature~.
  - The command *SHOULD* be accessible via the command palette.
  - The feature *MAY* have a configurable setting.

* 5. Non-Functional Requirements
  - *Performance*: The feature's core logic MUST execute in under 100ms on a standard machine.
  - *Usability*: The feature MUST be discoverable and easy to use. A keybinding SHOULD be provided.
  - *Accessibility*: Any new UI elements MUST adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

* 6. Proposed Technical Implementation
  A high-level overview of the technical approach.
  - *Affected Modules/Files*:
    - ~src/...~
  - *New Components*:
    - ~class NewFeatureProvider~ will be responsible for...
  - *Data Structures*:
    - A new interface ~INewFeatureData~ will be defined as...

* 7. Acceptance Criteria
  A checklist to verify that the feature is complete and correct.
  - [ ] *Given* [a precondition], *when* [an action is performed], *then* [an expected result occurs].
  - [ ] *Given* [another precondition], *when* [another action is performed], *then* [another expected result occurs].
  - [ ] All new code paths are covered by unit tests.

* 8. Out of Scope
  Clearly define what this feature will *not* do to prevent scope creep.
  - This feature will not support multi-user collaboration.
  - This feature will not initially provide a graphical interface.

* 9. Open Questions
  List any unresolved questions or issues that need to be addressed.
  - How should we handle error case X?
  - What is the desired behavior on platform Y?
