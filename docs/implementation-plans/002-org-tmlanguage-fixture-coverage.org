* OrgDown tmLanguage Coverage & Testing Plan

** Purpose
To ensure OrgDown's tmLanguage provides robust, accurate, and comprehensive syntax highlighting for all Org Mode features by following a systematic, fixture-driven testing workflow.

** Phase 1: Feature-by-Feature Fixture Design
This phase focuses on creating a dedicated test fixture for every individual Org Mode syntax element and its variations. The goal is to isolate each feature to test it thoroughly.

** Phase 2: The Test & Validation Workflow
For each fixture created in Phase 1, the following iterative process MUST be followed to ensure quality and prevent regressions.

1.  **[ ] Manual Review**: Visually inspect the highlighting in VS Code to confirm it matches expectations.
2.  **[ ] Snapshot Generation**: Run the test suite to generate a new colorization snapshot (`.json` file).
3.  **[ ] Snapshot Diff Analysis**:
    - If it's a new feature, approve the snapshot.
    - If it's a change, carefully review the diff. Ensure the changes are intended and don't affect unrelated scopes.
4.  **[ ] Iteration**: If highlighting is incorrect or causes regressions, update the `org.tmLanguage.yaml` grammar and repeat from step 1.
5.  **[ ] Mark as Complete**: Once the snapshot is approved and stable, check off the corresponding fixture in Phase 1.

** Phase 3: Integration & Regression Automation
This phase ensures that all features work together harmoniously and that our testing process is automated.

- [ ] **Automate Snapshot Testing**: Integrate the snapshot comparison into a CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run on every commit.
- [ ] **Kitchen Sink Validation**: Regularly review the `kitchen-sink.org` fixture's snapshot to catch any unintended cross-feature interactions.
- [ ] **Regression Policy**: Any change that unexpectedly alters an existing snapshot MUST be investigated. It's either an intended improvement that needs approval or a bug that needs fixing.

** Phase 4: Maintenance & Evolution
This section is for ongoing work and documentation.

- [ ] **Issue-Driven Fixes**: When a bug is reported via a GitHub Issue, create a new failing fixture that reproduces the bug, then fix it following the workflow in Phase 2.
- [ ] **Document Known Limitations**: Maintain a clear, user-facing document outlining any known edge cases or syntax that is not currently supported.
- [ ] **Grammar Refactoring**: Periodically refactor the `tmLanguage` source for readability and maintainability as it grows.

** Next Steps
- Begin creating the fixture files (`.org`) under `test/colorize-fixtures/` for each item listed in Phase 1.
- Follow the workflow in Phase 2 for each new fixture.
