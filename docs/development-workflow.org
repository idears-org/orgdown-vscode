* Development Workflow

This document describes the recommended workflow for developing new features for the Orgdown extension.

** Guiding Principles

- *Clarity over cleverness*: Code should be easy to understand.
- *Consistency*: Follow the established coding style and patterns.
- *Test everything*: Every new feature should be accompanied by tests.

** Steps for Adding a New Feature

1. *Create a Feature Document*:
   - Before writing any code, create a new Org Mode file in the ~docs/features/~ directory (e.g., ~docs/features/my-new-feature.org~).
   - In this document, describe the feature from a user's perspective, outline the technical approach, and define the acceptance criteria.
   - This ensures that we (and our AI collaborator) have a clear plan.

2. *Implement the Feature*:
   - Create a new branch for the feature.
   - Write the code, following the project's coding standards.
   - Add or update tests in the ~src/test/~ directory.

3. *Update Documentation*:
   - If the feature introduces a new command, keybinding, or architectural change, update the relevant documentation (~ARCHITECTURE.org~, etc.).

4. *Submit a Pull Request*:
   - Push the feature branch and open a pull request.
   - The pull request description should link to the feature document created in step 1.
