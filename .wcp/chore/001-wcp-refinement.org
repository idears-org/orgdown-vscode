* Goal
Evolve the Work Context Protocol to V5.0, establishing a complete project intelligence operating system by separating foundational knowledge from task management and implementing a reference-based knowledge base.

* Plan
- [X] Redesign WCP to include a master index, granular tracking, and a project intelligence file.
- [X] Rename the `work/` directory to `.wcp/`.
- [X] Create the `.wcp/_index.org` master task dashboard.
- [X] Create the `PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE.org` file and move it to `.wcp/`.
- [X] **Crucially, redesign the knowledge system to be reference-based, creating a `.wcp/knowledge_base/` directory that links to the authoritative `/docs` directory, avoiding content duplication.**
- [X] Update `GEMINI.md` to the full WCP V5.0 specification.
- [X] Upgrade task templates in `.wcp/templates/`.
- [X] Update `docs/4_architecture_decisions/007-work-context-protocol.org` to reflect the final WCP V5.0 architecture.

* Progress Log
** [2025-08-06]
- Completed all planned steps for the evolution of WCP to V5.0.
