* AI Instructions
The files listed above are high-level entry points. When a task requires deeper understanding, you MUST analyze their content for references to more specific documents (e.g., ADRs, feature specifications, etc.).

If you identify a relevant referenced document, you MUST inform the user and ask for permission before loading it into the active context. Do NOT load referenced files automatically.
