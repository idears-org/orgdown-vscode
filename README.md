## About The Project

Welcome to Orgdown! This is a Visual Studio Code extension dedicated to bringing the legendary organizational power of [Emacs' Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) to the modern, accessible environment of VS Code. Our mission is to faithfully implement 80% or more of the core Org Mode feature set, focusing on robust syntax highlighting, code block execution, and task management.

This project is built with a professional-grade, test-driven architecture to ensure stability and maintainability.

Learn more at our project websites: [orgdown.com](https://orgdown.com) & [orgdown.org](https://orgdown.org).

## Features & Roadmap

We are systematically implementing the full Org Mode feature set. To see a detailed list of currently supported features, as well as our development roadmap for what's coming next, please consult our **[[./docs/implementation-plans/002-org-tmlanguage-fixture-coverage.org][Feature Coverage Dashboard]]**.
